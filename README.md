# sentimentAnalyzer

Given a dataset with a list of tweets and a dictionary of good and bad sentiment words,  
I developed a project in python to check whether a tweet is positive or negative.

This project was originally an assignment for a course I did from Coursera: **py3 Programming by University of Michigan**.  
The dataset and dictionary was provided by them and I didn't have access to it. The code was written by me.
